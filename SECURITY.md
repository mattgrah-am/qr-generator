# Security Configuration Guide

## üîí Environment Variables & Secrets

### Local Development
The `.dev.vars` file (excluded from git) contains local development secrets:
```bash
NODE_ENV=development
BASE_URL=http://localhost:8787
```

### Wrangler Configuration
The `wrangler.toml` file contains infrastructure configuration that is acceptable to be public:
- D1 database ID and R2 bucket names are Cloudflare resource identifiers
- These are not sensitive credentials but resource names
- Access control is handled by Cloudflare's IAM system

### Production Deployment
The app is configured for multiple environments:

```bash
# Deploy to production
wrangler deploy --env production

# Deploy to staging  
wrangler deploy --env staging
```

**Note**: CPU limits have been removed from the configuration to support Cloudflare's Free plan. For paid plans, you can add CPU limits back in the `[limits]` section if needed.

### Environment-Specific Configuration
Each environment has its own configuration in `wrangler.toml`:

- **Production**: `https://qr.matg.dev`
- **Staging**: `https://staging.qr.matg.dev`
- **Development**: `http://localhost:8787` (from .dev.vars)

### Security Features Implemented

‚úÖ **No hardcoded secrets** - All sensitive data uses environment variables  
‚úÖ **Development bypass protection** - Only works on localhost in development mode  
‚úÖ **Proper .gitignore** - Sensitive files excluded from version control  
‚úÖ **Environment separation** - Different configs for dev/prod  

### Development Login Security

The `/api/dev-login` endpoint is secured with:
- **Host verification**: Only works on localhost/127.0.0.1
- **Environment check**: Only works when NODE_ENV=development
- **Double validation**: Both conditions must be true

In production, this endpoint returns 404 and is completely inaccessible.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Never commit `.dev.vars` to git
- Always use `wrangler secret` for production secrets
- The development login bypass is safe - it cannot work in production
- All Cloudflare infrastructure IDs are now properly secured
